creating a dynamic inventory means (autometically creating aws instance by ansible user with help of ec2.py,ec2.ini file)

=> localhost passwordless authentication 
  ssh localhost
=> creating ec2.py ,ec2.ini files on ansible user(ansible master server)
      $ vi ec2.py (copy paste the matter in the below link)
      https://fossies.org/linux/misc/ansible-2.9.10.tar.gz/ansible-2.9.10/contrib/inventory/ec2.py?m=t
=> creating ec2.ini (copy paste the matter in the below link)
   https://fossies.org/linux/misc/ansible-2.9.10.tar.gz/ansible-2.9.10/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini?m=t  
=>  then chenage the file permissions
     sudo chmod 755 ec2.py ec2.ini
 => seting environment veriables
 export EC2_ini_PATH="/home/gangu/ec2.ini"
 export ANSIBLE_HOSTS="/home/gangu/ec2.py"
 => creat a .boto file (in this file we provied aws credestials)(in user )
  vi .boto
  [Credentials]
  aws_access_key_id = 
  aws_secret_access_key = 
  
 => now creat a yml file creating instance through ansible node aim image id

  - hosts: localhost
    become: yes
    tasks:
     - name: creating instance with this palybook
       ec2:
        key_name: devopsg
        group: launch-wizard-18
        instance_type: t2.micro
        image: ami-0868d718d196e666c
        region: ap-south-1

        count: 2
        vpc_subnet_id: subnet-b1f085fd
        assign_public_ip: yes
   =>> by executing this we got two nodes in aws with same instance tag Name: ansible_nodes
   this are all autometically by useing ansible master server through ansible user
   => then create a yml file for insatlling package on node (which contains tag Name: ansile_node )
   like this

 - hosts: vpc_id_vpc_06657b6e (with the hlp of gathering facts we can assgin hosts : list) 
   become: yes
   tasks:
    - nmae: installing apache2 on dynamicnodes
      apt:
       name: apache2
       state: present
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 command for creating ansible user level dynamic invetroy file
  
  => $ ./ec2.py --list   (this command shows details of nodes)
  => ansible -i ec2.py -u gangu vpc_id_vpc06657b6e -m ping (this command for connection  checking of nodes )
  => ansible-playbook -i ec2.py -u gangu ymalfile name (to run playbook for nodes)
